# black_hole_raytracing

-I just updated the Runge-Kutta method to Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg for supposed improved accuracy, still 
need to test to make sure I implemented it correctly for many variables.  
-I just wrote a quick python script to analyze what my program is outputting at the moment, and the original picture I calculated for is attached below.   
-Then the second picture is what my program output for a small slice of the picture, with a supposed black hole in front of it.  
-The last picture is a zoomed in version of the small slice which seems to show some kind of optical effect taking place, I believe
this warrants a bigger slice being calculated.
