# black_hole_raytracing

-Fixed file printing the output issue. 
-In test folder, I tested the Runge Kutta Fehlberg routine on the simple 
problem of orbital trajectories. Found some issues in my understanding that have
now been fixed in this branch.  

-Current issue is that the program runs extremely slow and the angle values it outputs seem
extremely large and possibly incorrect.
