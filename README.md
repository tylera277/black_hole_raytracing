# black_hole_raytracing

** I need to go through and do some additional testing as my program has significantly regressed in quality at some point.

Full ray traced render computed on 11May2022. This is the most recent status of the program. This is missing the black parts of the black hole, where light cant escape, as well as the shift in light intensity around the black hole.
